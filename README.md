# Callback GroupMe NodeJS Bot

Intro
I got the bones of this code from the groupme bot-tutorial-nodesjs project which is supplied by Groupme. If you would like to look at that code go to the link below. They is a great readme on how to set it up. 

Additions: 
I linked the call back bot to a MongoDB to give the bot memory on heroku and then created a module for call and response. Then input logic that will let you from groupme add, and edit code along with running the call backs. 


Some of these files you may not need but its all there for reference just in case. Also I commented out some logic I put in to handle specific call and responses. I also removed the link to my mongoDB because giving everyone access to it would be bad. 

This code will not run right out of the box, you should follow the groupme tutorial and then switch their bot.js with my bot.js and set up your mongoDB then your bot should work.
